                    Hi again, my name is GÃ¶kay, and I am a full-stack web
                    developer based in Vancouver. I am in love with two things:
                    geology and magic. I have a degree in the first one and for
                    the second, I am currently studying software development.
                    Creating and building something unique on the web is the
                    closest one can get to real life magic.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    I started my journey of becoming a software developer on
                    June 18th, 2018. Yes, I do remember the date because that is
                    the day I made a firm decision to become one after years of
                    interest. Since then, I have been teaching myself web and
                    mobile application development and creating apps that use
                    various technologies in my spare time. By the end of 2019, I
                    decided to have a formal education in software development.
                    After long research, I enrolled in the Software System
                    Developer program at BCIT, one of Canada's most reputable
                    institutions. Having a strong interest and experience in
                    both frontend and backend languages, I am excited to further
                    my career as a full-stack web and mobile application
                    developer.
