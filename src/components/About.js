                    I am GÃ¶kay, a full-stack web developer based in Vancouver.
                    Science and computers have always fascinated me. I went on
                    to obtain a degree in geology but part of me always wanted
                    to learn more about the language of computers. Thus, here I
                    am, currently studying software development at BCIT. The
                    beauty of programming to me is that creating something
                    unique on the web is the closest one can get to real life
                    magic.

                    I started my journey to becoming a software developer on
                    June 18th, 2018. Since then, I have been teaching myself web
                    and mobile application development and creating apps that
                    use various technologies in my spare time. As productive as
                    my self-directed learning was, I decided to seek formal
                    education near the end of 2019 After extensive research, I
                    enrolled in the Software System Developer program at BCIT.
                    Having a strong interest and experience in both frontend and
                    backend languages, I am excited to further my career as a
                    full-stack web and mobile application developer.
